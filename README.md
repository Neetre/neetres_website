# neetres_website

This is the source code for my personal website. It is built using React for the front-end, Python FastAPI for the back-end, SQLite as DBMS for my database.
I've tried to keep the website as much dry as possible since I don't like overbuilt websites.

The next step would be adding a chatbot to the website, in order to answer some frequently asked questions.
